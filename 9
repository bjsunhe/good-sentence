Unit 1: SAP Master Data Integration in the Recruit to Retire scenario
Duration: approx. 12 minutes
Hello and welcome to the openSAP course,



00:05 / 11:12





00:05
Hello and welcome to the openSAP course,
00:08
SAP Master Data Integration in the Intelligent Enterprise,
00:12
week two, unit one,
00:15
Master Data Integration in the Recruit to Retire scenario.
00:19
My name is Vishal Trivedi
00:21
and I am with the Master Data Integration product management team.
00:26
Let us start by looking at how SAP is transforming
00:30
its support for HR business processes
00:33
by redefining the overall HR process strategy.
00:39
SAP has multiple solutions in the HR space,
00:42
focusing on individual use cases and LoBs.
00:46
For example, SAP SuccessFactors,
00:49
SAP S/4HANA, SAP Fieldglass, and SAP Concur.
00:55
These best-of-breed solutions
00:57
allow customers the flexibility
01:00
to innovate for the individual LoBs at their own pace.
01:04
However, what SAP brings to the customers
01:08
is a holistic suite of integrated offerings
01:11
on the Business Technology Platform,
01:14
which allow their business HR leaders
01:17
to offer exceptional experiences to the workforce,
01:22
as well as help their businesses grow
01:25
while keeping operational costs in check.
01:28
These integrated solutions allow HR leaders
01:32
to execute on their business transformation goals
01:35
and help them create the workforce of the future.
01:42
By now, this slide must be familiar to you.
01:45
SAP focuses now on delivering end-to-end business processes,
01:50
which span across all business functions.
01:53
The Recruit to Retire is one such process,
01:56
which encompasses SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Concur,
02:00
SAP Fieldglass, SAP Analytics Cloud,
02:04
and last but not the least, SAP S/4HANA.
02:08
These solutions target HR, travel,
02:12
controlling, and procurement enterprise functions.
02:16
Like other end-to-end business processes,
02:19
Recruit To Retire is also based
02:21
on the SAP Business Technology Platform,
02:24
which offers Master Data Integration as a core service.
02:31
Now let's take a look at what's the main objective
02:34
of Recruit to Retire.
02:36
What is the business problem the process is trying to solve?
02:41
Recruit to Retire strives to make
02:43
the workforce experience exceptional.
02:47
It enables understanding, managing, and optimizing
02:52
of all aspects of workforce management
02:55
in line with the business objectives.
02:58
Recruit to Retire is defined to cover the complete scope
03:01
of workforce management - planning, staffing, onboarding,
03:07
the actual working, travel, and settlement.
03:12
The process itself comprises of three main subprocesses -
03:16
Hire to Retire, which is focused on the lifecycle
03:20
of an internal employee,
03:22
Travel to Reimburse,
03:23
covering the travel and expense management aspects,
03:26
and then the External Workforce-focused
03:29
lifecycle management for an external employee.
03:36
The fundamental element
03:38
of building this end-to-end integrated workforce experience
03:41
is a unified data model,
03:43
which all participating applications have agreed on.
03:48
This is essential because all applications
03:52
need to speak the same language,
03:55
and without this, we cannot ensure
03:59
standard suite qualities for the process.
04:03
These aligned data models ensure consistent data
04:07
across the complete process value chain,
04:10
enabling data-driven insights and decisions.
04:14
Technically, aligned data models allow for
04:18
out-of-the-box SAP-to-SAP integration,
04:21
and also allow us to offer consistent APIs,
04:25
which are based on open standards.
04:31
The participating LoBs of the Recruit to Retire process
04:35
have agreed on and aligned people data model,
04:39
which covers important aspects
04:41
of the human attributes of the person, or the workforce,
04:46
like addresses, personal details,
04:50
communication preferences, and so on.
04:52
And then professional attributes, like job assignment,
04:57
payment methods, bank information, and so on.
05:01
The essential principle is to support the fact
05:05
that a person can have multiple work assignments.
05:13
Now that we have understood the need
05:15
of the unified data model,
05:17
and what a unified data model example looks like,
05:20
that is the people data model,
05:22
which we covered in the previous slide,
05:25
we get to the point where we need to understand
05:27
how this data is exchanged between the various participants
05:32
of the Recruit to Retire process.
05:35
This is where the Master Data Integration service steps in.
05:38
In the past, in order to share the information,
05:42
applications would have modeled and implemented
05:45
many point-to-point interconnections,
05:48
which are a nightmare to manage and maintain.
05:53
However, with the introduction of MDI,
05:56
we have a central service,
05:58
which makes the distribution of information
06:01
more efficient and optimized.
06:04
The idea is to enable a hub-spoke model,
06:08
which ensures consistent, scalable, compliant,
06:13
and purpose-driven master data replication,
06:16
even keeping DPP constraints in mind.
06:20
So MDI is like a central pipe
06:23
to which both the producing
06:26
and the consuming applications connect
06:28
in order to get the same view of the master data object.
06:33
MDI also speaks the same language
06:36
of the aligned one data model.
06:45
The next slide explains the interactions in more detail.
06:51
As mentioned previously, MDI provides a central pipe
06:55
to which both the producing
06:57
and the consuming applications connect.
07:00
It's important to understand that an application
07:03
can be both a producer as well as a consumer.
07:08
As outlined here, SAP SuccessFactors
07:12
is writing workforce person to MDI,
07:16
and then SAP S/4 is reading the workforce person from MDI.
07:20
The interaction gets reversed
07:22
when we talk about the cost center.
07:24
Here, SAP S/4 writes cost centers to MDI
07:28
and SuccessFactors receives them.
07:31
These interaction patterns are actually defined
07:34
by the business process flows.
07:41
When we go into the details of the process itself,
07:44
we see that "Cost center" element, "WBS" element,
07:49
"Bank" master data is owned by S/4
07:52
and is written to MDI by S/4.
07:55
The information is received by
07:57
SuccessFactors and Fieldglass.
08:00
SuccessFactors owns the workforce person object,
08:03
and the organization unit, as well as job details.
08:07
These are written to MDI by SuccessFactors.
08:11
Fieldglass owns and writes the external worker.
08:15
Based on business process needs,
08:17
new one data model objects are defined
08:21
and made available for consumption through MDI.
08:25
The definition and the rollout
08:29
of new data model objects is a continuous process
08:33
and goes on as the business processes evolve.
08:42
The concepts outlined in the previous slide
08:44
are further elaborated in the slide
08:48
which is on the screen now
08:49
and also the subsequent picture you will see.
08:53
Here in this particular picture,
08:54
we are talking about the financial data flow
08:57
across the Hire to Retire subprocess.
09:01
As you can see,
09:03
various components within the SuccessFactors and S/4 solutions
09:07
are communicating with each other
09:09
with data replication supported by MDI.
09:18
Similar to the financial data flows,
09:20
we have the HR data flow
09:23
flowing across the process landscape.
09:26
The workforce person itself is comprising information
09:30
from various sub-components of SuccessFactors.
09:37
So let us now summarize what we covered in this unit.
09:41
A smooth-running Recruit to Retire process
09:44
is critical for business continuity and remote work,
09:48
as well as ensuring exceptional workforce experience
09:53
for all kinds of workers.
09:55
By using aligned data models and MDI,
09:58
we provide an end-to-end experience,
10:01
which is comprehensive, has low-maintenance overheads,
10:05
and ensures harmonized suite qualities.
10:14
For colleagues who are interested
10:16
in learning more on Recruit to Retire,
10:19
I have listed some blogs, process blueprints,
10:23
and public roadmaps.
10:25
Please feel free to explore the links provided here.
10:31
We also have openSAP courses focusing on this end-to-end process,
10:36
which you're welcome to explore.
10:41
With that, we come to the end of the session.
10:44
Thank you for staying on,
10:46
and I hope you enjoyed it
10:48
as much as I enjoyed bringing it to you.
10:52
In case you are interested to know how MDI is being used
10:55
in other business processes,
10:57
I would encourage you to take the course titled

Hi team,

Integration between SF EC and SF ECP is still a point-to-point integration. Is there any plan to migrate to MDI?
