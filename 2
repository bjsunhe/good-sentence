Hello and welcome to the openSAP course,SAP Master Data Integration in the Intelligent Enterprise,



00:09 / 18:54





00:06
Hello and welcome to the openSAP course,
00:09
SAP Master Data Integration in the Intelligent Enterprise,
00:13
week one, unit one,
00:14
Introduction to SAP Master Data Integration.
00:18
My name is Arne Ludwig
00:19
and I am a product owner with SAP Master Data Integration.
00:25
Before we go into the details
00:27
of the SAP Master Data Integration service,
00:30
let me provide a little bit of context around this service.
00:35
So the idea is mainly driven
00:38
behind the Intelligent Suite
00:40
or the Intelligent Enterprise program,
00:43
where the program is mostly defined
00:46
by the major business processes.
00:48
So we do have processes like Lead to Cash,
00:51
Source to Pay, Recruit to Retire,
00:53
and Design to Operate,
00:55
which span across multiple different SAP applications.
01:00
So if we take the example of the Recruit to Retire,
01:03
for example, we see that there are multiple solutions,
01:07
such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors,
01:11
SAP Fieldglass, and SAP Concur being involved.
01:15
And to ensure that these processes run flawlessly
01:18
across the Intelligent Enterprise,
01:21
we need to make sure
01:23
that a certain integration or suite quality
01:26
is being achieved.
01:28
And for that, SAP invests into the so-called suite qualities.
01:34
And within this course,
01:36
we will mainly focus on the suite quality
01:39
of aligned domain models.
01:41
So if you're interested
01:43
in the overall Intelligent Enterprise idea,
01:50
there is also in unit two
01:52
a little bit more detail on that.
01:56
If you want to read up on further information,
01:59
you can also check the SAP Road Maps,
02:02
where you'll find new integration scenarios
02:06
being available in the future
02:08
via the Master Data Integration service.
02:12
You can find information
02:13
about the strategy of the Intelligent Enterprise
02:16
in the integration whitepaper.
02:19
And you will also be able to drill down
02:23
in the specific business processes,
02:25
identify which applications, which services are part,
02:29
and do this on the SAP API Business Hub.
02:37
So let's look into the SAP Master Data Integration service itself.
02:41
How does the service help
02:43
to achieve the suite qualities goal?
02:47
The main objective is to help business applications
02:51
to arrive at a consistent view on master data.
02:55
So what does it look like in practice?
02:57
Let's have a look at an example here.
03:00
So SAP Master Data Integration service
03:03
follows a hub-and-spoke model,
03:05
meaning that it is a central integration point
03:08
that is available for all applications to integrate with,
03:12
and hence on this example here,
03:14
we can see that on the lower-left side
03:17
there's an SAP S/4HANA solution,
03:20
creating a cost center,
03:21
and sending this cost center object
03:24
to MDI, to the Master Data Integration service.
03:28
When the SAP Fieldglass and SAP SuccessFactors solutions,
03:34
so all of the downstream clients
03:36
can basically retrieve the data from the service.
03:40
So in this case, they receive a copy of the same version
03:44
of the cost center object.
03:48
So what are the guiding principles
03:50
behind the SAP Master Data Integration service?
03:53
So first of all, we want to get away
03:55
from the current situation
03:57
where customer landscapes are often very complex and hard to maintain
04:02
due to various different point-to-point integrations,
04:05
depicted on the left-hand side here.
04:08
So we want to achieve a more centralized integration point
04:12
that you can see on the right-hand side,
04:14
where the SAP Master Data Integration service
04:17
serves as a hub in the middle.
04:19
So that overall will lead to a reduced maintenance effort,
04:23
since we only have a standardized way
04:26
of integrating with this service,
04:29
as well as an improved consistency
04:32
just due to the underlying principle
04:36
of every downstream client getting a copy
04:40
from the more or less same state.
04:43
And then furthermore, it will serve
04:46
as a first step towards fully managed SAP integrations.
04:52
And hence, this is a good step
04:56
to reduce the overall effort
04:59
in terms of creating integration scenarios.
05:04
There's not only standardization happening
05:07
in terms of the technical way, the protocol, so to speak,
05:10
to integrate with the service,
05:13
but there's also a second component to it
05:15
and that is the SAP One Domain Model,
05:18
and this One Domain Model is used
05:20
as the lingua franca for exchanging data,
05:25
or, in other words, this is describing the models
05:30
which are sent over the wire to the service.
05:33
So instead of having a situation
05:36
where each application integrates
05:38
with another application,
05:41
one would have to find multiple mappings
05:44
in between the different data models.
05:47
Now we do have the situation
05:48
that each application only needs
05:50
to provide a single mapping
05:52
from their local persisted suite
05:54
to the SAP One Domain Model,
05:57
and then afterwards
05:59
can exchange master data via the service.
06:04
The SAP One Domain Model is developed within SAP
06:09
by getting all of the LOBs
06:11
and the SAP solutions together
06:14
to verify that the relevant data
06:16
is available in those models
06:18
and to achieve certain qualities also
06:22
across these models.
06:24
If you want to learn more about the SAP One Domain Model,
06:27
I can recommend you listen in to the second unit as well,
06:31
where we will share more information
06:33
on the One Domain Model.
06:38
A third guiding principle
06:39
is that the Master Data Integration service
06:44
should actually serve
06:47
as a basis for providing out-of-the-box integrations,
06:52
meaning that SAP applications will come
06:55
with developed and kind of predefined integration
07:01
into the service, such that a customer
07:05
would only need to be left with the tasks
07:08
to identify what kind of master data
07:10
goes to what kind of an application,
07:14
such that the tedious work can be done by SAP,
07:18
whereas you define your businesses accordingly.
07:24
So what are some of the features
07:27
that the Master Data Integration service provides?
07:31
So first of all, a feature which is often being asked for
07:35
and which is available on the service centrally already
07:38
is the extensibility,
07:41
meaning that customers will and should be able to
07:44
extend also the One Domain Model models
07:47
to their specific needs,
07:50
such as an example here
07:52
where a workforce person, maybe in an aviation context,
07:56
needs to have an additional field
07:59
being added to the One Domain Model,
08:02
which could be a pilot license,
08:04
which defines what kind of aircraft this person
08:08
is allowed to fly.
08:12
Another functionality that the service provides
08:16
is the optimistic locking.
08:18
So what's behind this technical term
08:21
is basically that the service prevents
08:26
dirty writes from happening,
08:28
by that ensuring a certain consistency.
08:32
So what does it mean?
08:34
So assume that two applications want to
08:38
update the same master data instance,
08:40
for example, a workforce person Arne.
08:44
And in that case, if they do this simultaneously,
08:49
they will have to also provide for any update requests
08:54
something like a version ID
08:56
to the Master Data Integration service.
08:59
Sending this version ID with the update allows the service
09:05
to distinguish between clean and dirty writes,
09:10
meaning that if the version ID
09:12
that the application updating the workforce person Arne is sending
09:16
is equivalent to the version ID the service centrally has,
09:21
then this update can be validated,
09:28
whereas if the version ID is outdated,
09:31
the service is not allowed to update the workforce person.
09:35
In this case, the client 1 on the left-hand side
09:38
would need to get an update of the workforce person first
09:42
before being able to provide an update.
09:46
Another key functionality
09:48
of the Master Data Integration service
09:50
is the topic of filtering.
09:53
And that is important since you want to
09:55
control which data is replicated to which applications.
10:00
And that you can do on many different levels.
10:02
So the most prominent distinguishing parts
10:06
are the ways of filtering the data
10:09
either by instance or by segment filtering.
10:12
So with instance filtering,
10:14
we are referring to the complete records.
10:18
So you can define what kind of master data records
10:21
are being sent to which client.
10:24
As an example, you could take the workforce persons
10:28
for a certain country.
10:31
So let's say only a workforce person based out of Germany
10:34
should be allowed to be replicated
10:37
to a certain client.
10:41
Why is that is necessary?
10:43
Due to regulatory reasons,
10:45
maybe you want to restrict the data
10:48
an application is allowed to get.
10:51
Same, you can also control
10:55
in terms of filtering specific segments of the data,
11:00
meaning that you cannot only define which whole records
11:05
are being replicated,
11:06
but also which parts of the record are being replicated.
11:09
So taking the well-known business partner object,
11:12
which consists of supplier and customer-related information,
11:16
you will be able to define
11:18
that only supplier-related information, for example,
11:22
is supposed to be replicated to an application.
11:27
So it is important to know
11:29
that the service learns
11:32
or persists the data centrally,
11:37
and hence is able to react to filter changes.
11:42
So taking the example for the instance filtering
11:44
where workforce persons only out of Germany
11:46
should be replicated,
11:49
a customer could go ahead and modify the filter
11:52
by adding workforce persons of the US
11:57
to the same replication pattern.
11:59
And then the service would be able
12:01
to do something like a filter replay,
12:04
go over all the workforce persons available in the system,
12:08
and then inform the application
12:10
about what kind of workforce persons are available.
12:14
Similarly, the service also informs
12:19
if certain master data records
12:22
are not part of the filter anymore,
12:24
and that the application
12:25
will not receive any updates anymore.
12:29
Also important is that a similar activity happens
12:34
if a master data record leaves the filter scope.
12:39
So if the workforce person Arne changes the country
12:44
from Germany to, I don't know, France,
12:48
then I would not be part of the filter criteria anymore,
12:55
and hence, an application would be notified
12:58
that the workforce person Arne is from now on being excluded
13:02
from the replication set.
13:04
And that overall leads to a way
13:06
to keep the data consistent within the customer landscape.
13:14
Similar functionality can also be used
13:17
to provide data protection and privacy functionalities.
13:22
So there is the possibility to define purposes as filters.
13:28
We do also have read access logs for sensitive data,
13:32
and the data is only kept as long as applications
13:38
that own the data also have the data available,
13:40
hence if an application deletes the data,
13:43
it will also be deleted
13:46
on the Master Data Integration service.
13:51
So how does it look technically
13:53
without going into too many details here?
13:57
We can say that we are following a pull model, so to speak.
14:03
So obviously on the inbound side,
14:06
applications send or propagate changes
14:09
to the Master Data Integration service as events.
14:13
But also on the outbound side,
14:15
the communication is triggered by the application.
14:19
The application can choose its own schedule,
14:24
which is applicable to the current business needs
14:29
of the application or the business process,
14:32
and retrieve the changes of the service accordingly.
14:36
The communication, as mentioned earlier,
14:39
is based on the One Domain Model,
14:41
meaning that we, as the Master Data Integration service,
14:45
get object or master data records,
14:51
which are defined by the One Domain Model,
14:54
and we also only replicate those objects
14:56
within the One Domain Model.
14:59
So this is something
15:00
that the service also actually validates,
15:03
to make sure that we do have a certain data quality available.
15:07
This all happens
15:09
on an asynchronous event-based replication mechanism.
15:14
So the data is stored, the events are stored
15:17
on the service centrally,
15:20
but at some point in time,
15:22
according to the data privacy regulations
15:27
will also be deleted if necessary.
15:32
So these events are being persisted,
15:35
not only to support the filter mechanisms
15:38
we spoke about earlier,
15:40
but also to support longer offline periods
15:43
or to support scenarios
15:46
where initial loads are necessary,
15:49
for applications which are, for example,
15:52
newly onboarded to the landscape
15:54
or if a customer chooses to do a staged rollout
15:58
of the Master Data Integration service.
16:01
These applications can be onboarded one by one.
16:04
They will eventually receive the same data
16:07
according to filter settings,
16:09
as if they would have been part
16:10
of the landscape from the beginning.
16:14
All right, so before concluding,
16:16
I would actually want to highlight a specific solution,
16:19
which is called SAP Master Data Governance.
16:23
It has a special relationship to SAP Master Data Integration,
16:27
as you can tell from the name.
16:29
They both deal with master data
16:31
but they both serve different purposes.
16:35
As shown in this presentation,
16:37
SAP Master Data Integration
16:39
provides a replication mechanism, a very generic one,
16:45
on all various different master data objects
16:47
relevant for the Intelligent Enterprise.
16:51
Then the SAP Master Data Governance
16:54
is focusing on the very important master data object,
17:00
and providing additional value-adding functionalities on top of it
17:04
to improve the quality of the data.
17:07
So that is namely
17:08
the consolidation mass processing features,
17:11
as well as central governance
17:13
and data quality management things.
17:16
So overall, SAP Master Data Governance
17:21
can be used on top of SAP Master Data Integration
17:25
using the Master Data Integration service
17:27
as a replication mechanism
17:29
and providing additional means
17:31
to approve the overall master data quality
17:33
within the customer landscape.
17:36
And that brings me to the last slide,
17:39
which is an overview, a summary
17:41
of what we've seen in this presentation.
17:44
So SAP Master Data Integration service
17:47
is positioned as a central hub,
17:51
as an integration point in the middle,
17:53
to which SAP-branded cloud applications,
17:55
such as S/4HANA, are integrated out of the box.
18:00
We do have the possibility
18:03
to add a solution like SAP Master Data Governance on top
18:06
to provide additional data quality means
18:11
to the customer landscape.
18:13
There is also the option
18:15
to integrate third-party applications
18:18
via SAP Cloud Integration.
18:19
So since July 2022,
18:22
there is the first version
18:24
of a Master Data Integration adapter available
18:27
in SAP Cloud Integration.
18:29
We're also looking into means of integrating
18:33
or connecting with older SAP on-premise solutions.
18:39
And with that, we are at the end of the unit.
18:42
Thank you very much for listening
18:44
and we will see you soon in the next unit.
