Unit 2: More about SAP Master Data Integration and SAP One Domain Model
Duration: approx. 13 minutes



00:00 / 12:48





00:05
Hello, and welcome to the openSAP course,
00:08
SAP Master Data Integration in the Intelligent Enterprise.
00:13
Week one, unit two, More about SAP Master Data Integration
00:18
and the SAP One Domain Model.
00:20
My name is Arne Ludwig,
00:22
and I am a product owner with SAP Master Data Integration.
00:27
In this unit, we will cover three topics,
00:30
and we will start off with the Intelligent Enterprise
00:33
and how the SAP Business Technology Platform
00:37
can support customers
00:38
in their digital transformation journey.
00:40
We will then look into the SAP One Domain Model,
00:44
look what it is all about and how it actually helps.
00:48
And we will finally look into what is currently available
00:52
in terms of documentation of SAP Master Data Integration.
00:57
All right.
00:58
So we at SAP, we do have the goal to enable every enterprise
01:02
to become an intelligent and sustainable enterprise.
01:06
And that is important since data shows that large companies
01:10
on average have even more than 100 different applications
01:13
in their landscapes,
01:15
and hence rendering those IT landscapes
01:17
into a hybrid, very complex landscapes,
01:20
which are hard to maintain.
01:22
And given that business processes are spanning
01:27
across multiple different applications nowadays,
01:30
it is key that the digital transformation,
01:33
which also adapts
01:34
with the ever-changing end-to-end processes, is started.
01:39
So if we look at this slide on the right-hand side,
01:41
we can see that the intelligent, sustainable enterprise
01:44
is shown on top
01:46
of these industry-specific end-to-end processes,
01:49
such as lead to cash, design to operate,
01:53
source to pay, or recruit to retire.
01:56
And to ensure that all of these processes
02:00
can be run flawlessly.
02:02
SAP invests into suite qualities.
02:06
And here we namely invest into a seamless user experience,
02:11
consistent security and identity management,
02:14
embedded and cross-product analytics,
02:17
the aligned domain models, which are the key
02:20
or core content of this course,
02:23
the one workflow inbox,
02:25
the coordinated lifecycle management,
02:27
as well as end-to-end process blueprints.
02:30
And to make sure that all of these suite qualities are fulfilled,
02:35
we build those on the SAP Business Technology Platform,
02:39
which provides a holistic value proposition.
02:43
So the SAP Business Technology Platform
02:46
offers integrated processes by connecting data and processes
02:51
across different applications, not only within SAP,
02:55
but also across third-party applications.
02:58
It provides a means, in terms of data and analytics,
03:01
to provide actionable insights,
03:06
as well as offering tools
03:08
for fast and efficient application development.
03:12
And now, in the upcoming slides, we will further look
03:16
into the aligned domain models part,
03:19
which is based on the SAP One Domain Model.
03:24
So we do have the basic question,
03:26
why do we actually need this One Domain Model?
03:28
Well, in the last couple of years,
03:32
SAP has made a lot of acquisitions.
03:34
So we have now a broad portfolio of different applications.
03:39
Also, naturally, the scope and the data itself
03:45
in the applications evolve,
03:47
and hence we have a heterogeneous landscape
03:50
in terms of data models.
03:53
And one step to get into harmonization and standardization
03:59
is to create a common data model with common semantics
04:04
that can be used to exchange and replicate data,
04:07
but also to analyze data between applications
04:11
in the Intelligent Enterprise and its ecosystem.
04:15
Based on this One Domain Model, we will be able to provide
04:18
out-of-the-box integrations between SAP applications.
04:23
We will be able to offer easy ways of extending the data
04:27
and providing consistent APIs
04:29
based on the One Domain Model.
04:32
Overall, this further leads to lower integration effort,
04:36
and also, hence, reduces the TCO.
04:43
So, what would be the easiest way
04:46
to create such a domain model?
04:48
Well, obviously, one could simply go ahead
04:51
and define a model on paper,
04:54
and then take the best which seems to be out there,
04:59
but we will also need to take into consideration
05:02
what is currently available, right?
05:04
So, within SAP, all of these applications
05:08
share a certain set of data,
05:12
but they all look at the same data in a different context.
05:17
So in the workforce context, for example,
05:20
SAP SuccessFactors looks at employee data,
05:25
SAP Fieldglass looks at contingent workers,
05:30
multiple solutions look into finance-related objects,
05:34
such as controlling objects or cost centers.
05:37
And they all share a certain amount of this data.
05:40
On top, there's even more common data, such as language codes
05:45
or currency codes and country codes that are shared.
05:50
And in order to make sure that these applications avoid
05:55
having multiple individual point-to-point mappings,
06:00
where each combination, so to speak, needs its own mapping,
06:05
the idea of the One Domain Model
06:07
as the central language provides an easy means
06:11
to define a language for replication purposes.
06:16
So that's why the SAP One Domain Model
06:19
is used as a common model for business objects
06:22
across different SAP applications,
06:24
enabling those systems to speak the same language
06:28
during data exchange.
06:30
So here it's key that it is during data exchange,
06:34
meaning that everything which goes over the wire
06:36
is basically according to the SAP One Domain Model,
06:40
while the applications themselves
06:42
keep their local representation of the model,
06:45
and hence this leaves us with one mapping per application,
06:49
based on the One Domain Model.
06:51
So hence it enables the delivery
06:53
of deep out-of-the-box integration,
06:56
for easy extension and consistent APIs
06:59
across business processes
07:00
for the SAP Intelligent Enterprise.
07:04
So the definition of these models is basically done
07:09
in the Core Data Services definition language,
07:12
so the CDS format,
07:14
so just to ensure that we do have a machine-readable format,
07:18
which, for instance, is used by a service
07:20
such as SAP Master Data Integration service
07:26
to enable the replication.
07:30
So let's make it a little bit more tangible
07:32
and look at a concrete example.
07:35
So here on the left-hand side
07:37
you can see a cost center entity.
07:39
And on the right-hand side you can see
07:41
that all of the different SAP solutions
07:44
do have their local representation of the cost center.
07:48
Hence in SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors,
07:52
SAP Concur, and SAP Fieldglass,
07:54
they all have their own representation
07:57
of the cost center available.
07:59
It looks different in all places in a technical way,
08:03
even though they speak about the same cost center data.
08:07
And hence within the SAP One Domain Model,
08:11
internally within SAP we provide aligned entities,
08:14
such as the cost center, the ODM cost center,
08:18
which is then understood, and a mapping is identified
08:22
between the different applications at the ODM model.
08:30
So, if you are curious and want to learn more
08:32
about the ODM models at the current state,
08:36
please feel free to visit the SAP API Business Hub,
08:40
and there we do have the SAP One Domain Model Explorer
08:44
available for you.
08:45
You can drill down into various different details
08:48
and attributes, and play around,
08:51
figure out what's actually in there for the domain models.
08:57
So how does it come together then in the end?
09:00
So this SAP One Domain Model is being defined
09:03
by all of the SAP applications
09:06
and then being used by the SAP Master Data Integration
09:10
as the lingua franca, so to speak, for replication purposes.
09:15
So each application then integrates
09:17
based on the SAP One Domain Model
09:19
with the SAP Master Data Integration service.
09:23
And on top, we do have the SAP Master Data Orchestration component
09:28
that allows a customer landscape administrator
09:32
to define exactly what kind of master data needs to go
09:35
to which kind of application.
09:41
All right, so how do you eventually set
09:44
such a SAP Master Data Integration replication app?
09:48
So that you will learn within this openSAP course,
09:55
but there's also documentation available online.
09:59
So we do have the classic
10:00
SAP Master Data Integration help page,
10:04
and from which I would like to highlight a few sections.
10:09
So within the initial setup part, you will learn
10:12
how SAP Master Data Integration treats data buckets,
10:17
so isolated data buckets, so to speak,
10:20
and how applications can connect to such data buckets.
10:25
You will learn how to configure SAP Master Data Integration,
10:28
which allows you to specify
10:30
that exactly the needed data is going from one application,
10:34
or from the service tool, the dedicated applications.
10:40
Another topic I'd like to shed light on
10:43
is the integration part,
10:45
and there you will be forwarded
10:46
to specific application pages
10:49
where you can find additional information on integrations
10:53
with the SAP Master Data Integration service.
10:57
Then there is the security-related bucket, just to make sure
11:01
that the integration and the setup is correctly used.
11:06
And if you have any issues, please feel free
11:10
to look into our troubleshooting and FAQ section.
11:13
There is a guided answer part, which is ever-growing,
11:17
and you will be hopefully able to find your answers there.
11:22
Finally, pricing and regional information,
11:24
the information is available
11:27
in the SAP Discovery Center.
11:30
And with that, I'd like to reiterate
11:33
the key learnings of this unit.
11:36
So in the beginning,
11:36
we looked at the SAP Business Technology Platform
11:40
and how it supports the business transformation journey.
11:45
Then we looked into the SAP One Domain Model,
11:48
how this provides a common model
11:50
for exchanging data within the Intelligent Enterprise.
11:54
And finally, we just looked
11:55
at the SAP Master Data Integration documentation
11:59
and where to find further information on that.
12:03
As a final slide, I'd like to highlight
12:07
SAP's integration plan in the cloud,
12:10
which is in a white paper, which describes
12:13
how the digital transformation journey can be done.
12:17
I just want to highlight once again
12:19
the SAP One Domain Model Explorer,
12:22
to freely browse the SAP One Domain Model
12:27
and look into the details,
12:29
as well as the SAP Master Data Integration help page.
12:33
And with that, we are at the end of the unit.
12:36
I want to thank you very much for listening,
12:38
and we'll see you again in the next unit.
