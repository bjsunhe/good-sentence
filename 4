00:05
Welcome to the openSAP course
00:07
on SAP Master Data Integration in the Intelligent Enterprise.
00:11
This is week one, unit three.
00:14
How to set up an SAP Master Data Integration tenant and service instance.
00:20
My name is Tobias Nett,
00:21
I'm a content expert,
00:23
and I will guide you through this unit.
00:25
Let's get started.
00:27
In this unit we will first look at
00:29
the prerequisites required to use SAP Master Data Integration.
00:34
Then we will learn about tenants and clients
00:37
and how they relate to concepts in the SAP Business Technology Platform.
00:43
In particular, we will look at the differences
00:46
and similarities of producing and consuming clients.
00:51
Finally, we will look at service plans
00:54
offered by SAP Master Data Integration.
00:58
To get started with SAP Master Data Integration
01:01
you need a global enterprise account
01:03
in the SAP Business Technology Platform
01:06
and within that a subaccount.
01:09
Enterprise accounts are usually associated
01:11
with customer or partner contracts
01:14
and the entitlements they have purchased.
01:17
But it's also possible to use an enterprise account for personal exploration.
01:24
All accounts come with a default entitlement
01:27
for SAP Master Data Integration,
01:29
so we are set up with that.
01:33
Make sure to create a subaccount in the respective region
01:36
you want to use SAP Master Data Integration in.
01:39
Check out the SAP Help Portal for more information
01:43
on enterprise accounts and subaccounts.
01:51
Let's have a look at how tenants and clients relate to concepts
01:55
of the SAP Business Technology Platform.
02:00
Every application or system communicating and integrating
02:04
with SAP Master Data Integration is called a client.
02:08
On the technical level,
02:11
clients correspond to service instances or service bindings in the SAP BTP.
02:19
We will learn more about creating a service instance in the next unit.
02:29
Every client belongs to a tenant
02:32
determined by the subaccount the service instance is created in.
02:37
Clients of the same tenant are able to share data,
02:41
thus master data replication between those clients of a specific tenant is possible.
02:49
In contrast, clients of different tenants are isolated from each other
02:54
and cannot share any data.
02:58
We can use this property to build up landscapes
03:01
according to the needs of the business process or the customer.
03:07
We can use these concepts and properties
03:10
to shape the landscape based on the requirements given
03:13
by a customer or a business process.
03:17
To achieve data isolation between distinct groups of clients,
03:22
we can simply use different subaccounts.
03:26
For instance, a customer who wants to set up
03:29
a development landscape next to the productive landscape
03:33
can do that by creating a subaccount for each.
03:38
In the example we see here,
03:39
we have the productive landscape with tenant A on the left
03:43
and the development landscape with tenant B on the right.
03:49
The clients within each tenant can share data,
03:54
whereas the two landscapes are completely isolated from each other.
04:04
Note that for each sub-account in the SAP Business Technology Platform,
04:10
there can be at most one tenant of SAP Master Data Integration.
04:17
Let's have a brief look at consuming and producing clients.
04:22
Consuming clients are usually interested in changes to master data records
04:27
and they poll for these changes
04:30
at SAP Master Data Integration.
04:33
The polling interval can be freely chosen by the clients
04:39
and is usually determined by the business process.
04:49
Consuming clients may poll for changes
04:52
of one or many master data types.
04:55
For instance, client A here is interested in changes to business partner objects,
05:01
whereas client B is interested in both business partner and cost center records.
05:12
Note that there must be an active distribution model defined
05:16
describing the read permissions for the client
05:19
for them to receive any updates.
05:24
If a client is not only interested in changes to a master data type
05:28
but also notifies SAP Master Data Integration about modifications of the record,
05:34
it is called a producing client.
05:37
Note that producing clients don't directly change the data in SAP Master Data Integration,
05:43
but instead send change requests.
05:47
Such change requests describe an action or a modification of a master data record.
05:53
For instance, to create a new record, to update a field or to add key mapping information.
06:02
The SAP Master Data Integration service
06:04
will process these change requests asynchronously
06:07
and will notify about the outcome of the operation
06:11
in the outgoing change events.
06:14
Therefore, each producing client
06:17
should also be a consuming client polling for change events
06:21
and correlating these change events
06:24
with the change requests they have sent.
06:32
Note that write permissions govern which clients
06:35
are allowed to send change requests in the first place.
06:39
We will learn about this configuration
06:41
in the upcoming unit four,
06:44
where we create a service instance for a client.
06:52
When creating a service instance for a client
06:55
in the SAP Business Technology Platform,
06:57
you will need to choose a service plan.
07:00
SAP Master Data Integration offers two service plans.
07:05
Choose SAP integration when setting up
07:08
an SAP-branded cloud application.
07:12
For integrating an S/4HANA on-premise system,
07:16
choose the S/4HANA on-premise service plan.
07:21
Note that none of the service plans must be used
07:25
to connect other applications such as non SAP-branded cloud applications
07:31
or third-party applications or systems.
07:40
Let's close this unit with a short summary.
07:44
We learned that tenants of SAP Master Data Integration
07:47
correspond to SAP accounts in the
07:50
SAP Business Technology Platform.
07:53
Clients of SAP Master Data Integration
07:56
correspond to service instances or service bindings
08:00
in such a subaccount.
08:07
Changes to master data records can be replicated
08:10
between clients of a tenant, but are never replicated
08:15
between clients of different tenants.
08:19
Clients can consume and produce changes to master data records.
08:25
All producing clients should also be consuming clients
08:30
to learn about the outcome of their change requests.
08:34
And this is the end of the unit.
08:36
Thanks for joining in and see you in the next unit.
