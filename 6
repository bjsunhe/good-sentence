Hello, and welcome to the openSAP course,SAP Master Data Integration in the Intelligent Enterprise,



00:08 / 19:23





00:05
Hello, and welcome to the openSAP course,
00:08
SAP Master Data Integration in the Intelligent Enterprise,
00:12
week one, unit five,
00:14
Introduction to SAP Master Data Orchestration.
00:18
My name is Hans-Ulrich von Helmolt,
00:21
and I'm responsible for the development of SAP Master Data Orchestration.
00:27
Now, let's start with a business background
00:30
and the reason why an orchestration of master data is necessary
00:34
and so important in every extended landscape.
00:39
The list I have compiled here is, of course, not complete,
00:43
but it should contain the most important things.
00:47
Master data exists for multiple entities.
00:51
Mostly it is used to enrich business process data.
00:56
Master data normally will be distributed across the landscape
01:01
and is used there in multiple processes.
01:05
Master data may not need to be completely present everywhere.
01:11
Master data may as well have organization-dependent segments
01:15
belonging to different systems in the landscape.
01:19
Master data need to be consistent across a landscape in shared parts
01:26
to avoid process breaks.
01:28
That means all the needed data in business processes
01:34
have to be present when the business processes run.
01:39
Master data, and that is very important,
01:42
may be maintained in different places and in parallel,
01:47
or even close to simultaneously.
01:50
That creates high impact on the consistency of the data.
01:57
From this list it can be clearly derived that master data
02:01
are the backbone of business processes
02:04
in distributed and heterogeneous landscapes.
02:13
Orchestration of master data flows is therefore crucial
02:17
to ensure accuracy, consistency, and visibility of master data
02:23
across the complete cloud environment.
02:26
I've put cloud here in brackets because this can as well be valid for on premise.
02:34
SAP Master Data Orchestration has been created
02:37
to provide control of and information about the data distribution in the cloud
02:43
between registered applications.
02:48
It follows the solution approach listed here.
02:52
SAP Master Data Orchestration serves first
02:56
as a configuration UI for SAP Master Data Integration.
03:01
The distribution model is centrally maintained
03:05
and locally deployed in order to be available at runtime.
03:10
The data flow between provider and consumer applications
03:14
can be set up here, maintained, and monitored.
03:19
Key mapping information will be used to provide an overview of which master data is where.
03:28
With a view to the complexity of large customer landscapes,
03:33
it is clear that manual activity needs to be avoided wherever possible.
03:39
That means that scalability requires automation during setup and operation.
03:47
As an example, you may take the existence of automated notifications
03:52
about the state of the system
03:54
instead of permanent surveyance to check a monitor.
04:01
The next slide now gives you an overview
04:04
about the essential components and features
04:07
of Master Data Orchestration.
04:11
Of course, you will find some of the requirements
04:15
I just mentioned again.
04:17
But now, here on this slide, they mean features.
04:23
SAP Master Data Orchestration provides
04:27
the configuration UI for SAP Master Data Integration.
04:31
I will show one example later.
04:35
A central definition of distribution
04:38
and data ownership models,
04:41
model replication to Master Data Integration,
04:46
as well as the client libraries,
04:48
which exists for ABAP and Java environments,
04:52
although this I will explain in some detail.
04:59
Now, let me shortly go here to this diagram and explain it, at the right-hand side.
05:06
In the previous lessons you have been made familiar
05:10
with Master Data Integration,
05:12
which you can see here at the bottom,
05:16
represented schematically by inbound
05:19
Master Data event clock and outbound.
05:25
The diagram visualizes the flow of master data,
05:30
beginning with a change request on the inbound side here,
05:36
and then the consumption as change event on the outbound side,
05:41
following the intermediate storage in the MDI event log.
05:47
The term system here
05:50
stands for any instance like a system, a tenant,
05:54
or an application within the cloud, or even on-premise,
05:59
and means here, depending on the use case,
06:02
sending or receiving client as annotated here.
06:08
It is, of course, clear that not every system
06:11
necessarily sends and receives data in any case.
06:18
Now, let's come to MDO, Master Data Orchestration.
06:22
The role, its role here is to define the data flow.
06:25
That means to control which system receives which data
06:32
and sometimes, I come to that in a minute, also which system sends the data then to MDI.
06:41
At run time, this is indicated by the gray arrows,
06:45
the participants sent their messages
06:51
and log records to CALM/CRUN,
06:54
which may be used as a central instance for monitoring.
07:00
MDO, this is shown here, has an interface into CALM/CRUN
07:07
and can retrieve this information to display it
07:11
and provide end-to-end monitoring by this.
07:15
This feature will be delivered soon.
07:20
Before I show you now the Master Data Orchestration service,
07:26
let us for a moment stay with architecture.
07:29
As I mentioned on the previous slide,
07:32
the models defined in Master Data Orchestration
07:35
are replicated to Master Data Integration,
07:39
as well as to the client libraries.
07:42
There is mainly two of these which are quite different,
07:46
the ABAP and the Java library.
07:51
The ABAP client/library,
07:53
also known as ABAP protocol adapter
07:58
gives a so-called high-level abstraction
08:01
of the Master Data Integration APIs in SAP systems.
08:08
Even though Integration is a single service,
08:11
integration needs to be developed
08:14
for each master data object.
08:17
The ABAP client, however, manages the generic parts.
08:23
It controls pulling and pushing data from SAP Master Data Integration,
08:29
including remote configuration from SAP Master Data Orchestration.
08:36
Also, it supports the monitoring
08:40
that is the mentioned CALM CRUN integration
08:43
via the SAP application integration framework.
08:49
The Java library, however,
08:52
because it has no essential persistency
08:56
does not provide control functionality,
08:59
it is only wrapping the REST APIs.
09:03
Development is in progress
09:06
to also provide end points
09:08
for the SAP Master Data Orchestration configuration.
09:13
This will be provided following the approach
09:19
that configuration should happen centrally
09:22
in SAP Master Data Orchestration
09:25
and not in each of the consuming application.
09:29
The reason for this is quite trivial, of course.
09:33
Different UIs tend to confuse the user,
09:37
it's a pure usability question.
09:41
Application-specific APIs are needed to transfer control data
09:46
into local distribution software.
09:52
The next slide gives you an introduction,
09:55
a quick view on the Fiori UI.
09:58
I'll not comment further on this
10:00
because everything I will show here
10:03
in the upcoming demo of this and the next unit.
10:11
You might understand that this is, of course,
10:14
an advertisement to stay with us in the course.
10:18
And now, let's come to the demo,
10:22
I will here now go into the system.
10:30
So, now I can show you the system in some detail here
10:35
to give you a first impression on what SAP Master Data Orchestration looks like.
10:43
On the Fiori launchpad, which is presented here,
10:46
you can see two applications.
10:50
I've hidden all the other applications
10:54
that are existing but are not needed for the sake of this course and the next course.
11:01
So, you see here only Manage Business Object Type.
11:06
I think you already learned a little bit about the background of the data definition
11:15
in Master Data Integration, this is the object data model.
11:19
And the business object types then really tell you
11:24
what are the business objects that you can use for distribution.
11:31
Here, when I go to some detail you see you can configure.
11:40
First of all, by selecting the object,
11:45
you select also the API version
11:49
in which this object can be distributed.
11:53
This is relevant for the supported data structures.
11:58
In addition, you can here, I show this very quickly,
12:05
switch on the interface to data protection and privacy for this object,
12:13
that is, you can activate the business context.
12:17
I mention this here because, due to some technical problems,
12:21
in these two units we cannot display this, or we cannot demo this,
12:26
and so you only need to know the location
12:29
where you can activate it.
12:31
I will come to this in the next unit
12:34
when I go into deeper detail of the maintenance.
12:39
One thing which will also come within then one of the next sessions is extensibility,
12:47
which you can activate here,
12:51
and this will be shown in a corresponding part there.
12:56
For now I'm leaving this application here,
13:00
just wanted to have this shown to you,
13:03
and go to the essential one,
13:04
where we manage distribution models.
13:08
As this is a brand new client, tenant,
13:15
there are no models, of course,
13:18
but I want to show you the UI and the screen.
13:24
And therefore I press here Create,
13:27
and with the view to it you will see
13:30
that this is very similar to the screenshot.
13:35
And when I make it full screen
13:38
then you will see that completely and entirely
13:43
corresponds to the screenshot I have shown on the slide.
13:48
To the details of it, I will come in the next unit.
13:52
What I want to make you aware of is the help function here,
13:55
because this offers a pretty nice feature as an online help.
14:01
When you go here to one element on the right-hand side
14:07
it will show you where it is on the screen,
14:09
you can as well go over this,
14:12
and then you will get a definition here, a help note.
14:19
But you can even do more,
14:21
you can go to What's this app?
14:25
And this will then lead you directly into the SAP Help Portal
14:32
where you find the full set of documentation,
14:38
probably you have had access to this before.
14:42
For a moment to return to my demo,
14:45
I have now to leave here the fullscreen mode
14:48
and go back into my demonstration.
14:53
And then I can, when I want to, I can make this sidebar small
15:02
but still keep the demos here.
15:05
But mostly when you are accustomed to it you then will switch it off.
15:10
Let's now return to the slides.
15:16
On this slide I give you a short outlook
15:20
of things that are, so to say, in the pipeline of SAP Master Data Orchestration.
15:28
We will deliver what I already mentioned,
15:30
end-to-end monitoring capabilities via the use of CALM/CRUN
15:36
to collect lock messages from a participating application.
15:42
These will be periodically extracted
15:44
to SAP Master Data Orchestration and displayed there.
15:49
And we will use the knowledge of the distribution models,
15:54
which is a value add, to create a process view on that.
16:00
What I did not touch here, but I mentioned it with the terms of data consistency,
16:08
is the feature of data ownership,
16:11
which offers consistency and integrity of master data in distributed landscapes
16:18
that often can have parallel changes, as I mentioned.
16:24
It offers views on the master data model
16:27
to define which application owns what part of the data.
16:32
This clearly refers to the fact
16:36
that different systems or instances
16:38
can be responsible for different parts of the data.
16:43
I remind you of the plant data of a product, for instance,
16:48
which can be treated in different instances for production.
16:54
It will provide communication rules
16:57
to control the validation and the redistribution of data
17:02
following maintenance operations.
17:05
That means create, change, or delete.
17:09
And that is one of the reasons
17:11
why Master Data Orchestration was named orchestration,
17:16
it orchestrates the message flow.
17:21
In addition, it will offer monitoring and conflict resolution, possibilities, and options,
17:31
because a pure monitor or detecting of an error is not enough,
17:36
you need to have options directly to go into the system
17:42
and fix the problems.
17:44
Then you have to redistribute because the data consistency
17:49
is so important for the business processes,
17:52
without that they cannot run.
17:57
At the end of this unit,
18:01
you have learned how to identify
18:04
SAP Master Data Orchestration as the operational cockpit
18:08
based on SAP Master Data Integration.
18:12
You should now be able to understand the basic architecture
18:16
of SAP Master Data Orchestration
18:20
on top of SAP Master Data Integration.
18:24
You basically saw the essential apps
18:28
and know how to handle them.
18:35
On this slide, I show you two links
18:39
to the documentation of Master Data Integration,
18:44
and to the documentation of SAP Master Data Orchestration.
18:50
I already forwarded you to that within my demo.
18:56
And with this, we are really at the end of the unit,
19:02
and hopefully you will join us in the next unit again,
19:06
where I will provide more detailed information
19:09
on how to handle Master Data Orchestration.
19:13
For now, I thank you very much for your kind attention.
